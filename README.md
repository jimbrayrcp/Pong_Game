# The Classic Game of PONG
### Reimagined in Python v3.9 using Turtle
<br/> 
<br/>


Living in 1972 long before cell phones and video game consoles, this was the hottest new thing in gaming.&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, it was the only thing in electronic gaming. <br><br>It's almost hard to imagine even today walking into a roadside restaurant or fuel station and finding one of these bad boys sitting there.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [Read more about the oddly interesing history of Pong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong) <br/> <br/> 
While building this project, I was amazed to find this blast from the past remains fun and entertaining.
&nbsp;Although, I can't imagine spending as much time playing this game as the people of those times in history. 


This is a two player game, but one person can do it if you're talented enough to use the keyboard combinations. <br/>**Be warned,** every time you or your opponent hits the ball, the ball moves increasingly faster.
and much harder to hit.

**First player to get 8 points wins.**

## Installation:

**With Python 3 using the console**
>1. Download the pong folder 
>2. Place the folder into your python directory
>3. Open the console app and type: `python3 /<path to your python directory>/pong/main.py`

<br/>

**With Pycharm**
[_taken directly from the pycharm website_](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/set-up-a-git-repository.html#put-existing-project-under-Git)

>1. From the main menu, select Git | Clone, or, if no project is currently opened, click Get from VCS on the Welcome screen.
>2. In the Get from Version Control dialog, specify the URL of the remote repository you want to clone, or select one of the VCS hosting services on the left.
>If you are already logged in to the selected hosting service, completion will suggest the list of available repositories that you can clone.
>3. Click Clone. If you want to create a project based on the sources you have cloned, click Yes in the confirmation dialog. Git root mapping will be automatically set to the project root directory.
>If your project contains submodules, they will also be cloned and automatically registered as project roots.

**Other _similar to pycharm_ integrated development environments (IDE)**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; check the IDE creator's website for this specific information. Here are a few different ways you may find this information to be labeled._
>1. Check out a project from a remote host
>2. Clone a project from github
>3. Download files into application
